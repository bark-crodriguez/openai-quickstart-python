  <h3>AI ad generator</h3>
  <div class="body_text"> 
    The Bark AI ad generator app is a text-to-ad tool. Simply describe your ad idea and the app will provide you
    with a few image ideas and some fine-tuned copy. You can further refine both assets after they are created. You can 
    download you assets in various formats or directly import them into various ad publishing platforms once you are
    satisfied with the output.
